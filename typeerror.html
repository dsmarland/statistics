  <h2> Example 1 </h2>
  <p>Lucy can hit the target 70% of the time when she throws an axe with her right hand. She claims that the proportion, 
  p, of her throws that hit the target is higher than 70% when she uses her left hand. 
  Lucy uses the hypotheses \(H_{0}:p = 0.7\) and \(H_{1}:p > 0.7\) to test her claim. Lucy makes 100 throws and will reject the null hypothesis if the axe hits the target more than 77 times.</>
  Let X -B(100,p) be the number of times lucy hits the target when using her left hand,
  </br>
  P(Type 1 error) = P(being in critical region|Ho is true)
  </br>
  P(Type 1 error) = \(P(X \gt 77| p = 0.7)\) 
  </br>
   P(Type 1 error) = \(P(78\leq X \leq 100|p = 0.7)=0.04786\)
  </p>
    <h2> Example 2 </h2>
  <p>Lucy can hit the target 70% of the time when she throws an axe with her right hand. She claims that the proportion, 
  p, of her throws that hit the target is higher than 70% when she uses her left hand. 
  Lucy uses the hypotheses \(H_{0}:p = 0.7\) and \(H_{1}:p > 0.7\) to test her claim. Lucy makes 100 throws and will reject the null hypothesis if the axe hits the target more than 77 times.</>
  Let X -B(100,p) be the number of times lucy hits the target when using her left hand.
  Given that Lucy actually hits the target 80% of the time with her left hand, 
  find the probability of a Type II error
  </br>
  P(Type II error) = P(not being in critical region|true population parameter)
  </br>
  P(Type II error) = \(P(X \leq 77| p = 0.8)\) 
  </br>
  P(Type II error) = \(P(0\leq X \leq 77| p = 0.8)\) 
  </br>
   P(Type II error) =  0.261
  </p>
  <h2> Example 3 </h2>
  <p>
  In the following scenarios, decide whether a Type I error or Type II error could have occurred
  (i)
A farmer is testing for a change in crop growth after trying a new fertiliser. The test concludes that there is no evidence of change at the 5% significance level.
 

(ii)
A dentistâ€™s receptionist believes that the waiting times have been reduced due to a new scheduling system. They conduct a hypothesis test and will reject the null hypothesis if no more than two customers wait more than ten minutes. Exactly two customers have to wait more than ten minutes.
</p> 
 <h2> Example 4 </h2>
  <p>
  The probability of getting a head when a coin is tossed is denoted by p.
This coin is tossed 12 times in order to test the hypotheses H0: p = 0.5 against H1: \(p \neq 0.5\), using
a 5% level of significance.
</br>
  Given that p = 0.4
  </br>
  Find the probability of a type-2 error.
 </br>
 When p = 0.5 rejection region \(P(X\geq 10)\) or \(P(X\leq 2)\)
 </br>
 When p = 0.4 acceptance region   \(P(3\geq X\geq 9)= 0.9137\)
