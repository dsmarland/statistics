<h1>Hypothesis Testing <h1>
<p> Using the same study from Example 8.1, Templer and Tomeo (2002) reported that the
population mean on the quantitative portion of the GRE General Test for students
taking the exam between 1994 and 1997 was 558 ¡À 139 (m ¡À s). Suppose we select a
sample of 100 students enrolled in an elite private school (n = 100). We hypothesize
that students at this elite school will score higher than the general population. We
record a sample mean equal to 585 (M = 585),</p>

Compute the one independent sample z test at a .05 level of significance.</p>

<p> H1 : \(\mu = 586\)</p>
<p> H1 : \(\mu \geq 586\)</p>
<p>  z = \(\frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}} \)</p>
<p>  z = \(\frac{558-586}{13.9}}=-1.94 \)</p>
